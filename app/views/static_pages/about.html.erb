    ProtectedPlanet.net is the online interface for the World Database
    on Protected Areas (WDPA), a join project of IUCN and UNEP, and the
    most comprehensive global database on terrestrial and marine protected
    areas. ProtectedPlanet.net lets you discover the protected areas of
    the world through exploring the maps and intuitive searching, feeding
    you information from the WDPA, photos from Panoramio and text
    descriptions from Wikipedia.

  <p>ProtectedPlanet.net is the new face of the World Database on
  Protected Areas (WDPA). Its humble beginnings started 30 years ago as
  the United Nations global list of national parks and has evolved into
  the only global, spatially referenced information source on parks and
  protected areas. We have created ProtectedPlanet.net not only to
  showcase this wealth of information, but also give tools to willing
  ‘citizen scientists’ who can feed their knowledge about protected
  areas into the WDPA.</p>

  <p>ProtectedPlanet.net allows you to search in any language to find
  information about individual protected areas. If you don’t know
  exactly what you are looking for, you can explore the world from the
  maps. Our aim is to make use of the huge resources out there and
  concentrate our efforts on delivering the most relevant and accurate
  protected areas information to the global community.</p>

  <p>The World Database on Protected Areas is managed at UNEP-WCMC in
  Cambridge, UK supported by IUCN staff and the IUCN World Commission on
  Protected Areas. It relies on the magnitude of work carried out by
  staff in institutions in every country that work on mapping and
  collating information on protected areas. Without this work from
  governments and NGOs alike, there would be no World Database on
  Protected Areas.</p>

  <p>If you are a national protected areas data manager and want to find
  out how to contribute to the WDPA, please contact
  protectedareas@unep-wcmc.org and our team will be happy to help
  you.</p>
